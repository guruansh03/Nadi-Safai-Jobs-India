            <p>"Seechewal began the project along with a few volunteers in 2008, finally giving Punjab back a pristine tributary eight years later. For his volunteers and him, who’re ingrained in the practice of “sewa” (voluntary service), the work had a spiritual purpose. People from more than 24 villages joined the movement, cleared the riverbed of hyacinth and silt, and built a lovely riverbank.

                The government didn’t even help with an awareness campaign, so Seechewal launched his own, encouraging villagers to throw and treat their waste differently. The outcome was amazing — a government order to divert the water from a nearby canal was received and the natural springs were revived again. For some time in 2008, the river was thriving, enjoying its second lease of life. It had even turned into a picnic spot.
